If you or they were banned, it was for a good reason. There is a way to appeal, and that is by talk to **@Aceheliflyer#0950** via DM. In your appeal, include the date you were banned on, why you were banned *(you should know this)* and why you would like to be unbanned. If you feel that you were unfairly banned for a misunderstanding or a bot accidentally malfunctioned, contact a staff member with an alternate account or get a friend to.\n\n***(Appealing does not guarantee that you will be unbanned.)***"},{"title":"No, you can earn guild points the more you talk.
